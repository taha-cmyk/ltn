Embedding Google ratings on your website can enhance credibility and showcase your business's reputation. Here's how you can do it:

### **Option 1: Embed Google Reviews Using Google's Review Embed Tool**
Google provides a built-in tool to embed reviews directly from Google Maps.

- **Go to Google Maps**:
   - Search for your business on [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com).

- **Access Your Business Profile**:
   - Click on your business listing to open its profile.

- **Find the Reviews Section**:
   - Scroll down to the "Reviews" section.

- **Click the Share Icon**:
   - Click the share icon (usually a square with an arrow) next to the reviews section.

- **Embed the Reviews**:
   - Select the "Embed a Map" option.
   - Copy the provided HTML code.

- **Paste the Code on Your Website**:
   - Paste the code into your website's HTML where you want the reviews to appear.

### **Option 2: Use a Third-Party Widget**
If you want more customization or additional features, you can use third-party tools like:

- **Elfsight Google Reviews Widget**:
  - Visit [Elfsight](https://elfsight.com/google-reviews-widget/).
  - Create a widget, customize its appearance, and copy the embed code to your website.

- **EmbedSocial**:
  - Go to [EmbedSocial](https://embedsocial.com/).

### **Option 3: Manually Display Ratings**
If you want to display your overall rating (not individual reviews), you can manually add a star rating and link it to your Google reviews page.

1. **Get Your Overall Rating**:
   - Check your Google Business Profile for your average rating.

2. **Add HTML/CSS**:
   - Use HTML and CSS to create a star rating display. For example:
     ```html
     <div class="google-rating">
       <span class="stars">★★★★★</span>
       <span class="rating">4.8</span>
       <a href="https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=YOUR_PLACE_ID" target="_blank">Leave a Review</a>
     </div>
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_PLACE_ID` with your Google Place ID (you can find it using tools like [Place ID Finder](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id)).

3. **Style with CSS**:
   - Add CSS to style the stars and rating.

### 3. **Important Notes**:
.Ensure you comply with Google's terms of service when embedding reviews.
- Regularly update your embedded reviews to reflect the latest feedback.
- Encourage customers to leave reviews to improve your rating.
